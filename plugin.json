Loads [known functions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vasco-jofra/format-string-finder-binja/master/src/data/default_printf_like_functions.data) that receive a format parameter.\n 2. For each xref of these functions find where the fmt parameter comes from:\n    1. If it comes from an **argument** we mark it as a **'format string like'** function and test its xrefs\n    2. If it is a **constant** value located in a **read-only** area we mark it as **safe**\n    3. If it comes from a known **'safe' function call result** (functions from the `dgettext` family) we mark it as **safe**\n    4. Otherwise we mark it as **vulnerable**\n 3. Prints a markdown report\n\n## Settings\n - `format_string_finder.should_highlight_variable_trace`:\n   - Highlight instructions that are used in the trace of the format parameter origin.\n - `format_string_finder.should_enable_tests_plugin`\n   - Enable the tests plugin. Only for development.",
